# Project CodeNet
Project CodeNet is a collection of submitted solutions to problems compiled by IBM. More details here: https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet

I have taken a subset of these submitted solutions based on their associated problem (problems that would be expected to have increased time complexity corresponding to their input parameter size), taken any "Accepted" (valid) solutions and wrapped these in a function handler ready to be ran as a FaaS function; these compiled functions are then added to the Hetergeneous FaaS system for evaluation.

Solutions written in Python, Go and C# have been used. This provides a range between interpreted and compiled languages with differing traits.

## Selected problems
The following subset of problems from the Project CodeNet data repository has been selected:
- P00002: "Write a program which computes the digit number of sum of two integers a and b."
-
