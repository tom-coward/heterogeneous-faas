# heterogeneous-faas
This is the implementation of my university Third Year Project.

## Abstract
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), following its initial widescale release as AWS
Lambda, has rapidly gained popularity in recent years as a quick and easy model
for application developers to deploy their applications upon, taking advantage of
other recent developments such as event driven architectures and cloud
computing. This rise coincides with the equally promiment rise in proliferation
of IoT and other edge devices, many of which are heavily reliant on real-time
data and increasingly making use of intense AI and analysis workloads currently
predominantly exclusively executed in the edge or cloud. This project aims to
explore how a FaaS architecture, currently primarily adopted in relatively
homogeneous cloud environments, can be deployed across a heterogeneous
network consisting of both edge and cloud infrastructure, by dynamically
orchestrating requests between the edge and cloud with the help of machine and
transfer learning. The projectâ€™s results show promise in the field and present
some interesting findings regarding the handling of data in environments as
dynamic as an edge-cloud FaaS infrastructure.
